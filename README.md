A MERN stack based personal project which allows a logged in user to purchase credits and use 1 credit to send out surveys to a list of recipients.

The user is allowed to customise the subject, body and recipients for each survey. All the mentioned recipients are then sent an email containing the subject and the body along side with two links using which the recipient can use to respond with either YES or NO. 

The user's dashboard will showcase all the surveys and total no. of YES and NO for each survey.

The project uses services like Sendgrid for sending out emails and Stripe for payment gateway integration, to allow us to charge some amount for equivalent credits which can then be used by a user to send out surveys.
